      "message": "I was trying with similar approach, I was even looking at Retrier which we are already using in the Gerrit Core.\nI can see few point to discuss with this approach:\n1. This is basically recursion, each failing thread creates a new thread. If one of the remotes is not responding and we have a lot of changes happening we can run out of threads. Original code was taking a single thread per change and it was retrying without consuming any additional resources. I\u0027ve manage to reproduce it by adding a breakpoint on receiver site\n2. nit: We are creating additional work queue for RestForwarderScheduler\n3. nit: change 285925 introduce locking on the forwarder side, this approach is not release a lock between retry which is a code smell\n\nChange https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/plugins/high-availability/+/286700 is so invasive because it is closing all thread and releasing all locks",
