      "message": "I am not 100% convinced that is going to work.\n\nImagine that the repository as some very complex Prolog rules (e.g. using the owners plugin and looping through all the files in the patch-set) and it takes several seconds to compute them.\n\nThe change C1/PS1 receives at T1 a new patch-set and therefore triggers a IDX1 event.\nIDX1 is getting forwarded and therefore C1 is added to the inFlightIndexing set.\nThe processing of IDX1 will take 60s to complete. That time will be spent as follows:\n- T1 \u003d C1/PS1 is read from the receiver side\n- T1 to T1+59s \u003d C1/PS1 Prolog rules are getting executed and the result stored in Lucene\n- T1+60s the IDX1 finishes and C1 is removed from inFlightIndexing\n\nNow, if at T1+30s a new PS2 is uploaded to C1, a new IDX2 event is created, still associated with the C1 change. Because of L58, this results in an exception thrown at L78 and the *legitimate* reindexing of PS2 is not propagated to the receiver side.\n\nDoes that scenario makes sense to you?\nIf yes, then this change introduces a regression.",
