      "message": "We are currently running stable-2.14 in production and to adapt the proposed feature we would need to rework replication plugin a lot. On the other hand, this solution is adds functionality to HA to \"re-trigger\" project events happening on the active master side, so that the passive master would be able to pick it up in the replication queue and perform replication. By default the feature is disabled.",
