      "message": "I like this idea but do you mind if we hold on merging this change?\n\nSince upgraded to 2.14, we have this issue[1] which is most likely a bug in Guava cache. When the issue happens, the LoadingCache is unusable until you restart Gerrit.\n\nWe spent a lot of time trying to investigate/reproduce/fix this issue with no luck so far. Investigating this issue made us realize that there are quite a few major issues reported on Guava cache that were never fixed. One of the Guava cache former developer wrote another cache[2] which he claims to be the 2.0 of guava cache.\n\nI have a change which is replacing Guava cache by Caffeine but before uploading it in the open source, I want to run it in production for one two weeks to be sure it fix the problem and do not bring other problems.\n\nEven though I prefer the way the code is in your change, I would like to hold on merging it and if my caffeine test in production is a success, I would prefer that we use a Caffeine cache instead. \n\n[1]https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id\u003d7645\n[2]https://github.com/ben-manes/caffeine",
