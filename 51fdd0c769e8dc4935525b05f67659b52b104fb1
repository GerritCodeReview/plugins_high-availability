The events forwarding will pile up of the active peer and when the  other peer is brought back online, all piled up events will be forwarded.\n\nIf we want to proceed with your proposed change (stop forwarding when peer goes offline), we need a mechanism to resync a peer that went offline.",

In case the peer goes offline for any reason, the RestForwarder retry forwarding events(the number of retries and delay between them is configurable).\n\nActually the retry logic is in the HttpClientProvider and CloseableHttpClient. Right?\nIIUC, the RestForwarder itself is unaware of any retry logic.\nHowever, if it doesn\u0027t try to forward an event the http client will not know about it\nand there will be no retry.\n\n\u003e If we want to proceed with your proposed change (stop forwarding when peer goes offline), we need a mechanism to resync a peer that went offline.\n\nEven more: the peer that went offline, may start on a different VM and the http client doesn\u0027t know that it has\nto retry for the new URL of the other peer.\nActually, this issue is just a special case of the setup with N \u003e\u003d0  peers with auto discovery, where both N\nand each peer URL can change at the runtime.\n\nIt looks to me that in such case, the retry logic at the http client level is not enough.\n\nResyncing a peer sounds like a good proposal. Just in that case, we would need to pile up last events for a configured\namount of time, even when forwarding to existing peers works. Then when a new peer joins the group, it receives\nall pilled up events. The assumption here is that the newly joined peer cannot be older than the oldest pilled up event.\n\nBtw, the functionality of resyncing a (new) peer is a precondition for adding a new peer to the existing group.\n\nIt seems like the functionality of resyncing a new peer would be a more intrusive change.\nI will think about it over night :-)\n\nAny further ideas/comments are welcome.",

Right?\n\nYes I meant the forwarding using REST as a general concept, not the RestForwarder class itself. I should have been more clear.\n\nCurrently, the plugin works only in failover mode with 2 peers. The assumption is before installing this plugin, both peers must have the same info, i.e, they share repositories, database, they each have a copy of the secondary index and the caches. Once this is true, then this plugin can be installed and both peer brought online and from this point on, the will be maintained synchronized (caches, indexes and stream events).\n\nAdding support for n peers is something but adding the support   to join a un-synchronized peer is a big challenge. Honestly, the biggest issue is secondary index, the caches problem could  be solved by simply flushing them on new new peer joining. I think that ElasticSearch support in Gerrit is mandatory before we consider support joining a new un-synchronized peer.\n\nLet\u0027s go back to the immediate problem you need to solve. If I understand correctly, you will have 2 masters running on 2 different machine/VM but the problem is you do not know the IPs/hostnames in advance. After the initial discovery, it could be possible that one of the 2 peers rejoin  with a different IP/hostname. Is this your main/only problem so far?",

We can postpone this topic for some time.\nJust for the sake of discussion: Even without the elastic search we could create another peer by stopping\nan inactive instance, making a copy of it (including a copy of the lucene index), and then start both of them.\nIn principle both of them missed the same number of events.
