      "message": "Depending on the file system and Git configuration, this may also create a hard-link to that file in the same directory. However, we will only schedule `TouchFileService` for the lock file itself. Therefore, the `StaleLockRemoval` may find those hardlink files, detect them as stale and delete them. Creation of those hard-links is an implementation detail in JGit and we do not want to proliferate that knowledge into this plugin.",
