      "message": "ChangeFinder.findOne(id) is using only one cache along the way, ChangeNotesCache. The values from ChangeNotesCache are immutable, see explanation in [1].\n\nSomething that smells funny is ChangeNotes.reload method id not used in the core, not a single call to this method. Is is possible that reloading the change is fixing the issue becauce it is a second reading after a delay(delay being the first reading)?\n\nThat said, if this improves the situation, I am OK with this change.\n\n[1]https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/78433",
