This folder need to be shared by both instance and even if you have 2 instances on the same machine, they will each have their own review_site.\n\nIt could work by specifying the sharedDirectory as a relative path in one instance and absolute path in another. Is there a good reason to forbid such a setup? If yes, then we have also to forbid that\nthe sharedDirectory is under any (of the 2) review_site\u0027s to make the whole story consistent. \nHowever, from one review_site we don\u0027t know where the other review_site is and we cannot\nenforce that an absolute sharedDirectory is not under the other review_site.\n\nI don\u0027t have a hard opinion on this but, as said, it feels artificial to forbid relative path.",
