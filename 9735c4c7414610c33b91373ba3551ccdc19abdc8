Is this what is meant by \"stale\" in the commit message?\n\nIf so, would consider specifying this constant null case (in the commit message). Maybe also mentioning that before this change, we then kept entering this if block, as currTs was always null, thus rewriting the file despite sometimes latestTs not being after the real currTs.",
