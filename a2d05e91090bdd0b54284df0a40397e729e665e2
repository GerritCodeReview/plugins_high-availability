The returned payload also contains the project names which could be confidential.\n\n\u003e I put this into the HA plugin because I thought this is a highly specialized endnpoint (condensed response, no visibility checks, no limit) for the HA plugin scenario.\n\nSure, I did something similar also in the past for the reindexing, so it makes sense in this context. Thanks for clarifying.\n\n\u003e Considering the given arguments what is your opinion?\n\nI like this change, it is a quick and lightweight way to recover the index alignments from a temporary outage very quickly.",

This query is run frequently, hence I think it makes sense to add an optimized API.\n\nAs an experiment I ran a change query `age:2min` on our productive server, it returned 100 changes, response size was 3.3 MB, the list of 100 changeids in the response format used here had the size of 2.5kB which is a reduction by a factor of 1.3k.\n\n[1] https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/Documentation/rest-api-changes.html#change-info",
