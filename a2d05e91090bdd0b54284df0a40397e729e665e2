      "message": "The main difference is that the standard change query returns a full `ChangeInfo` [1] per change which is a lot of data. This implementation only returns the changeids. This query is run frequently, hence I think it makes sense to add an optimized API.\n\nAs an experiment I ran a change query `age:2min` on our productive server, it returned 100 changes, response size was 3.3 MB, the list of 100 changeids in the response format used here had the size of 2.5kB which is a reduction by a factor of 1.3k.\n\n[1] https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/Documentation/rest-api-changes.html#change-info",
