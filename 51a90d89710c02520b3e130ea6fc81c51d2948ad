I think to prevent this the reindexing in the standby would need to happen synchronously in the same transaction as the modification on the active instance.",

If there is a lag and the change is modified again, another reindex and checker is responsible for the new IndexEvent.\n\nIf checker is after reindex, the standy will mistakenly assume that the latest change data from NFS had already been loaded but actually it load an old one.",
