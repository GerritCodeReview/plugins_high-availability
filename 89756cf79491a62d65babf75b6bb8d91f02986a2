      "message": "The problem is that we cannot instantiate \"Val\" class which is the class serialized/deserialized on disk, the constructor is not public.\n\nOne of these file is a valid serialized websession that allow to do most of the FileBasedWebsessionCache unit tests. That one can be removed if we change make Val constructor public, which I will do on master.\n\nThe other one is serialized dummy class that I need to unit test ClassNotFoundException handling.\n\nThese 2 files are allowing us to have a unit test line/branch coverage close to 100%. I know they are binaries but they are small are not likely to change so they will not cause the git repository size to explode.",
