      "message": "There is no project name: Gerrit does not tell what was the project but only the change number. Because the change isn\u0027t there anymore, you cannot really do anything to extract that information.\n\nPassing a project parameter would be just a lie: there is no project name.\n\nWhat would be worth instead, is getting rid of the smelly \"new IndexChangeTask(\"\", id, true, new IndexEvent())\" which honestly is NOT readable at all (I believe I wrote it, I must have been too sleepy).\n\nI would propose for a follow-up change to have a dedicated new DeleteChangeTask(id).\n\nWDYT?",
