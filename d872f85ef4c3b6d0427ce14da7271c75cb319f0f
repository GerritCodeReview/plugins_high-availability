      "message": "I considered this option but what made me think about this programmatic approach was the TODO you had in the original change: how to configure the threads. In this case, we just need to read the values from the configuration and pass them here as we do with sharedFolder (line 117). Sure, you can also change those values in the XML file but another consideration we had to propose this default configuration was the ease of use by admins: if we just expose some of the configurable values in the plugin configuration (like the threads options, for example) it could be easier to modify than editing an XML file.\n\nFor sure, the option to pass a different configuration as an XMLfile is preserved and the first option before falling back to this default configuration.\n\nAnother option I need to explore is the possibility of reading the XML file as you propose but to override some of the values if they are present in the configuration. That will address both concerns; I\u0027ll take a new look as soon as I have some time (but for sure, not later than early next week).",
